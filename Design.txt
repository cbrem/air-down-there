Mechanic: Oxygen
  * Players are on a carbon-dioxide-rich planet, and need to enclose plants and
    let them grow to generate oxygen.
  * On the surface, oxygen slowly runs out.
  * Players die permanently if oxygen runs out?
  * how can players find their way to leaks?
    - c02 sensors
  * to make it hard to seal all openings:
    - cave-ins: triggered by underground explosions, propagate upward in
      lines (may or may not reach surface)
    - meteorites create surface craters

Mechanic: Mech Suit
  * Players have very limited mining capabilities on their own, but can build a
    mech suit that greatly increases this.
  * built from parts which can be:
    - found: wreckage blocks
    - bought: full parts
  * parts can fail, and accumulate wear (from falls or from normal use?)
  * some mech parts can be used
  * player has mech view where they can equip/unequip tools

Environment: Block-based
  * like 2d minecraft. can only add/remove whole blocks
  * block types:
    - outside blocks:
      * acid: eats away rock, pools on surface
      * lava: eats away at rock below it? pools under ground
      * rock
      * dirt: can be mined with hands
    - inside blocks:
      * water
      * doors: can create chambers which are multi-room and therefore safer

Environment: Generation/Representation
  * caves which connect to surface should be long and hard to follow
  * environment is 2D object of frames.
    - has indices, but is an object so that they can be negative
  * when we add a new frame:
    - draw a random number of lines (0-3) through it
    - for each line:
        * pick a starting direction (-1 <= dx <= 1, -1 <= dy <= 1)
          and line radius (0-3)
        * keep stepping forward. each step:
          - at each step, pick a direction within 1 of current
            * if we're going diagonally, zero dx or dy
            * if we're going hor/vert, unzero dx or dy
            * also some chance of stopping
          - draw a circle around current position with rad within 1 or previous
            * to approximate a circle, draw in all directions, counting
              diagonals as 1.5 blocks
